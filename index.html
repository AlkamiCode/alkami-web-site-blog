      <h2>What Is Your Mission?</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Technology should be accessible. Small businesses, early stage companies, and pre-revenue startups all need and deserve high-quality software development. Getting it shouldn’t be cost-prohibitive.
      We are passionate about providing quality web and app development at rates that are fair to our clients and sustainable for our team. We are not a consultancy; we are your partners on an adventure to new possibilities.

            Want to hear our dirty little secret? We love design! Users typically only see the front-end of an app/website and we want their first impression to be extraordinary.
