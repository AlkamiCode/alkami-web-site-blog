      <h3>LookAgainDoc</h3>
      <i><h5>Client: SecondLook, Corp</h5></i>
      <p>Look Again Doc makes it much easier for patients to get second opinions from some of the best medical centers in the US. So many patients struggle with finding the right specialist when they are looking for a second opinion from an ivy-league institution. Look Again Doc not only helps take the guess work out of the second-opinion process, but it also helps patients really understand whatâ€™s going on with their disease through their easy to understand personalized videos. It also saves the time and expense of traveling to another city or state for that second-opinion.</p>
